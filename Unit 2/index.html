  <header><h1>The CPU</h1>
  <p>The driving force for desktop and mobile devices since 1955</p>
  </header>

<p>In todays world of technological reliance the CPU has evolved so far that we are about to break into the next level of computing.</p>
   <p>But before we get into that let's take a look at the 4 main CPU suppliers in the world!</p>

  <ol type="a"> 
   <li>Desktop & Laptop</li>
     <ul>
      <li>Intel</li>  
      <li>AMD</li>
     </ul>
     
   <li>Laptop & Mobile devices</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Qualcomm</li>
      <li>ARM</li>      
    </ul>
  </ol>

<p>With Nano Meter processing getting smaller and smaller allowing for more transistors, thus improving performance and power consuption. We have made absolute bounds in progress on the power of CPUs. When CPUs were first created their "speed" or instructions per second were 0.002 million, now we have CPUs that can do 500 million!</p>

<p>Personal preferance on who I side with for the brains of my computer and mobile device</p>
   <p>AMD&gt;Intel</p>
   <p>ARM&lt;Qualcomm</p>
