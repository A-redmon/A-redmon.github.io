 <h1><i>Music and the links to our emotions</i></h1>
 <h3>“MUSIC CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A TYPE OF PERCEPTUAL ILLUSION IN WHICH OUR BRAIN IMPOSES STRUCTURE AND ORDER ON A SEQUENCE OF 
 SOUNDS. JUST HOW THIS STRUCTURE LEADS US TO EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL REACTIONS IS PART OF THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC.”</h3>
 <h4>Daniel Levitin (American-Canadian cognitive psychologist, neuroscientist, writer, musician, and record producer.)</h4>
 <p><b>Music is something special. some call it a universal language, while others call it the window to the soul.</b>
 No matter the type of music you listen to, there is no denying at some point you have felt a connection with what you heard. 
 Wheather that connection was through love, hate, sadness or a combintaion or the 3 music has a special way to intensify these 
 feelings.</p>
  <p>The nerological science behind the connections we make with music has been studied for a long time. here is a list of things we do know about our brains response to music.</p>
<ol type="1">
 <li>Music can't be tied to just the left side or the right side of our brain it activates many parts.</li>
 <li>Beat, Tempo, Pitch and intensity, also play a role.</li>
 <li>Musics ability to stir up past memories, and invoke intense or painfull emotion.s</li>
</ol>
